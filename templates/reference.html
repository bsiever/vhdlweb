<li> <a href="https://nobodywasishere.github.io/vhdlref/">VHDL language reference</a> by <a href="https://nobodywasishere.github.io/">Margret Riegert</a>.  This is a cleaned-up version of an older guide, with some updates for VHDL-2008.
<li> <a href="https://www.hdlworks.com/hdl_corner/vhdl_ref/">VHDL-93 language reference</a> from HDL works.  This is a clean and complete VHDL reference guide, but only covers VHDL-93.
<li> <a href="https://www.nandland.com/">NANDLAND</a> has a good VHDL reference and a set of tutorials on desiging various useful circuits.
<li> <a href="https://vhdlwhiz.com/basic-vhdl-tutorials/">VHDLwhiz</a> has a set of free tutorials.  The author takes a somewhat unconventional approach starting with testbenches rather than synthesizable code, but he generally explains with clarity and detail.
<li> <a href="https://www.fpgatutorial.com/vhdl/">FPGA Tutorial</a> blog with a series of articles on key big topics in FPGA/VHDL design.
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220402093841/https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jmoorkan/vhdlref/">An old archive of a VHDL-93 language reference</a> from Jayram Moorkanikara at UC Irvine.
<li> <a href="https://www.edaplayground.com/">EDA playground</a> is an online editor where you can run VHDL code with a number of simulators.

<ul class="booklist">
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/free_range_vhdl"><span class="booktitle">Free-Range VHDL</span></a> -- This free book is one of the most concise and helpful introductions to VHDL I've found.
Written by Bryan Mealy and Fabrizio Tappero, distributed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC-BY-SA</a>.  

<li>Ricardo Jasinski, <span class="booktitle">Effective Coding with VHDL: Principles and Best Practice</span> -- This is an excellent book that describes how to do things <emph>correctly</emph> with VHDL.  It goes through each feature of the language and describes not only how to use it, but how to use it effectively for clean and maintainable code.
