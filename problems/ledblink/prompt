Instantiate the iCE40UP's onboard 48MHz oscillator and use it to drive a counter.  Use a bit of the counter as an LED output, and observe the resulting frequency.<br/>

The lab handout says to use a 26-bit counter, to get an LED blinking at human-visible timescales.  However, simulating 2^26 clock cycles will bring the poor server to a halt and cause your simulation to time out.  Please use the 10th or maybe 15th bit, and you can switch to 26 bits when you try the real hardware.<br/>
<br/>
Also be sure to initialize the counter -- otherwise it'll start at X, and incrementing will just give X, getting you nowhere.
