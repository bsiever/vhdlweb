Write a testbench to check that the module `abc` computes \\(Y = AB + \overline{B}C\\)

The module has the following declaration:

    module abc (input logic a, b, c,
                output logic y);

As before, your code should print the word "failed" if the DUT fails any of your tests.  If the testbench does not print the word "failed", the test is assumed to pass.
