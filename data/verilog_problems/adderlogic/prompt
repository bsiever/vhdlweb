Just as it's helpful to define intermediate variables in a software program, it is often useful to define intermediate signals to represent part of a hardware computation.

Declaring a signal is just like declaring an input or output port, except that it occurs within the body of the module, and doesn't have the keyword `input` or `output`.

<pre>
  logic onebit;
  logic[2:0] mybus;
</pre>

Implement a 3-bit adder without using the addition operator, by writing boolean assignments for each bit.  A and B are 3-bit inputs; the result should be a 4-bit output (so there should be no overflow.)

Use intermediate signals for the carry bits.
