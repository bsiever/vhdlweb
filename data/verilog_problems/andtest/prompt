Write a testbench to check that the module `andgate` (not visible to you) actually performs as an AND gate.

Your code should print the word "failed" if the DUT fails any of your tests (i.e., the DUT doesn't perform as an AND gate for one or more sets of inputs).  If the testbench does not print the word "failed", the test is assumed to pass (i.e., you're saying the DUT is a fully-functional AND gate).

To complete this problem successfully, your testbench must do two things:

1. Not report any errors on any DUT which is correct
2. Report at least one error for any DUT which is incorrect

To check whether you're writing a good testbench, VHDLweb will run your testbench on multiple DUTs, some of which are correct and some of which are broken.
