When a circuit is first powered up, the output values of the flip-flops are random and need to be initialized to a known state.

In the previous problem, we did this simply by waiting a few clock cycles before examining the output.
But in circuits that have feedback, the unknown values are passed back to the inputs, producing unknown values indefinitely.

The solution is to include a "reset" signal.  If a clock edge occurs while the reset signal is high, then the circuit assigns known values to the flip-flops instead of performing its normal operation.  Once the reset goes low, the circuit resumes its normal operation, but this time starting from a known state.

Complete the module to describe the circuit below, which uses a synchronous reset to initialize both flip-flops to 1.  (If you leave them at zero, the circuit just stays stuck at zero, but otherwise it follows an interesting pattern.)
