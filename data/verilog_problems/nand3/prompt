SystemVerilog uses the keyword `assign` to indicate a combinational assignment.
In the assignment statement

    assign y = a & b;

any change to `a` or `b` will immediately cause `y` to be updated, which describes
the behavior of an AND gate.

Complete the module below to implement a three-input NAND gate: \\(Y = \overline{ABC}\\)
