A bus is a set of signals which are grouped together conceptually (and often physically).  One way to represent a bus is with `std_logic_vector`, which is somewhat similar to an array in software programming languages.

We can declare a 3-bit input bus called `votes` with
<pre>
  votes : in std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)
</pre>

With this declaration, you can use `votes(0)` to refer to bit 0 of `votes`, `votes(1)` for bit 1, and `votes(2)` for bit 2.  The `(2 downto 0)` part specifies that this is a 3-bit bus where `votes(2)` is the MSB and `votes(0)` is the LSB.

Complete the architecture to build a majority encoder: the output `y` is 1 if the majority (i.e., at least two) of the input bits are 1, and 0 otherwise.
