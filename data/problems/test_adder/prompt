Write a testbench to check that the module `adder` actually performs correctly as a 4-bit adder.<br/>
<br/>
You probably want to use some kind of test generation, rather than writing out all the cases. A VHDl `for` loop might be useful:
<pre>
for INDEXVAR in MIN to MAX loop
 -- loop body, which can use INDEXVAR
end loop;
</pre>

Note that INDEXVAR is an integer (not an unsigned or std_logic_vector), so you'll need to convert it to the appropriate type if you hope to do any comparisons.  Take a look at the reference sheet for how to do conversions.
