Write a testbench to check that the module `adder` actually performs correctly as a 4-bit adder.

You probably want to use some kind of test generation, rather than writing out all the cases. A VHDL `for` loop might be useful:

    for INDEXVAR in MIN to MAX loop
     -- loop body, which can use INDEXVAR
    end loop;


Note that INDEXVAR is an integer (not an `unsigned` or `std_logic_vector`), so you'll need to convert it to the appropriate type if you hope to do any comparisons.  Take a look at the reference sheet for how to do conversions.
