A powerful construct for specifying combinational logic is `when/else`:
<pre>
OUTPUT <= VALUE when (CONDITION) else OTHER_VALUE;
</pre>

Complete the architecture below to build a 2:1 multiplexer.  The inputs A and B are each 1 bit, and the select line S is a single bit.  When S is low, Y should have the value of A; when S is high, it should have the value of B.
