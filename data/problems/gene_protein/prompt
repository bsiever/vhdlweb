A ribosome starts building a protein when it encounters the sequence `ATG`, known as a "start codon". It
knows the protein is complete once it encounters one of three "stop codons": `TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`. Everything
in between is part of the protein code. (Itâ€™s more complicated, of course, but this is the basic gist).

Write a VHDL module which streams the genome through, and asserts the `is_protein` signal every time the module emits a nucleotide which is part of a protein, including the start and end codons.

It should be able to handle all three of the stop codons, and deal with multiple protein sequences back-to-back.
