Build a 4-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register">linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) </a>.<br/>

An LFSR is essentially a shift register where a few of the bits are set to result of XOR-ing other bits in the register.  This results in the shift register producing a pseudo-random series of numbers.  With careful construction, the pattern can be made to cycle through all possible combinations of bits (except for all 0s) before repeating.<br/>

Your 4-bit LFSR should use the design below.  When reset, the value should be `0001`.
