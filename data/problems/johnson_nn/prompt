Build a 4-bit Johnson counter, sometimes also called a "twisted ring" counter.  This is similar to a one-hot counter, except that the feedback bit is inverted, giving a sequence of values containing 1s as well as 0s:

    0000
    0001
    0011
    0111
    1111
    1110
    1100
    1000

This has the nice advantage that it encodes twice as many states as a one-hot counter for the same number of flip-flops plus an inverter.

When reset, the value should be `0000`, and subsequent values should follow the pattern above.
