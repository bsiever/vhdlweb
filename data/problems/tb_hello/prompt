The VHDL command `report` prints a message to the console log:

```
report "MESSAGE";
```

Complete the architecture to print the message "Hello, world!", and then "Goodbye!" 200ns later.

(Note that VHDLweb does not currently check your output; you'll need to examine it yourself to see if it's correct.)
