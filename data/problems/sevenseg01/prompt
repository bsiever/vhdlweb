std_logic_vector makes it easy to compare and assign whole buses, which dramatically simplifies the work necessary to specify combinational logic.

For example, if `value` is a 4-bit bus, we could compare it with a constant:
<pre>
    value = "1101"
</pre>

Similarly, if `output` is an 8-bit bus, we could set all the bits at once with
<pre>
    output <= "0001111"
</pre>

Complete the architecture below to display the value of S using the digits 0 and 1 on a 7-segment display.  The output should be a vector of bits corresponding to the LED segments, in the order "abcdefg".
