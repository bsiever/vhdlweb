Build a Moore FSM which accepts an input which could change on each clock cyle, and outputs a `1` after detecting the pattern `001` on the input stream (meaning that on the previous three clock cycles, the input bit was 0, then 0, then 1.)

You can define a new type (similar to a C `enum`) in VHDL using the syntax:

    type State is (ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, ETC);

With the type defined, you can then create a signal with this type, and use it like any other signal.

    signal s : State;

A reset signal isn't necessary here; your state machine should reset itself back to a known starting state any time the current state is invalid.  The `when others` clause of a `case` statement will be helpful here.
