Complete the design to implement the DDDD.

When you run it, you should see the value of the digits 0-63.

To perform the mod operation correctly, you should use

    lowBCD <= count mod 4d"10";

Make sure to use an unsigned constant (e.g., 4d"10", rather than the integer constant 10).  If you don't, then the behavior depends on the synthesis/simulation tool, and you may get some ugly surprises.  Some things work fine here and fail in Radiant, and vice-versa.

As with the original 7-segment display problem, ignore the pass/fail output and verify by inspection that the result is what you want.
