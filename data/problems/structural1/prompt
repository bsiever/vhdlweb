Complete the architecture below to implement this block diagram with submodules `thing1` and `thing2`.  (Have no fear, [these things are tame](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/catinthehat-171014111223/95/the-cat-in-the-hat-by-dr-seuss-10-638.jpg?cb=1507979610).)

You'll need to base your component declarations on these entities:

    entity thing1 is
      port(
    	  s : in std_logic;
    	  t : in std_logic;
    	  y : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)
      );
    end thing1;


    entity thing2 is
      port(
    	  e : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
    	  f : in std_logic;
    	  g : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)
      );
    end thing2;
